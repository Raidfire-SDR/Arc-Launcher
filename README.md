Arc Browser Launcher for Windows 11 to workaround fail to launch issue

On Windows 11 Arc fails to launch afetr the 1st run, this launcher will upon each runtime: 
Get your system username and truncate it to the new 5 character win11 standard.
Clear the offending cache files preventing launch.
Launch Arc.

Please note it will leave a terminal window open until arc is closed, a compile that included hiding the terminal was seen as malicious behaviour by windows defender and quarantined the file on each run, i will investigate hiding the terminal without the anti virus triggers for a v2.
